# Celestia Community Calls Repository

This repository will be a place to contain all community calls that the Celestia community will have in order to facilitate discussions and keep the community up-to-date on all things Celestia.

There is also the public Celestia Community calendar that will have these calls. You can add the calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19za2JzbjIzNWszYmlzdHNoZ3RvNmw5ODYyNEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).
